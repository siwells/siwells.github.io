Publication: SUPERHUB Deliverable D1.1 - Scenarios

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The SUPERHUB project aims at realizing a new services mobility framework supporting an integrated and eco-efficient use of multi-modal mobility systems in an urban setting. SUPERHUB provides a user-centric, integrated approach to multi-modal smart metropolitan mobility systems by means of an open platform able to combine in real time various mobility offers and provide a set of mobility services able to address user needs, promote user participation and foster environmentally friendly and energy&ndash;efficient behavioural changes.<br />The deliverable D1.1, "Scenarios" provide a first version of the SUPERHUB usage scenarios and hence the functionality that SUPERHUB shall provide, informed by user research. This encompasses (i) a first identification of the stakeholders and end-users of SUPERHUB, (ii) a first identification of the most relevant usage scenarios, (iii) a first establishment of user research methodology for SUPERHUB, and (iv) the first user research into what problems citizens and other stakeholders currently experience, their opinions on the scenarios, and their expectations of SUPERHUB. <br />From an operational stand-point, Deliverable D1.1 marks a milestone in the project work plan, in that it will effectively kick-off the user centred design activities of WP6 and the user trial methodology activities of WP8, and provides enough insight into the envisaged SUPERHUB functionality (further elaborated in the initial requirements specification which is not part of this deliverable and will result in deliverable D1.2) to allow the technical WPs to start designing their sub systems. The scenarios elucidated in this deliverable will be refined in Deliverable D1.4 ("Final scenarios, requirements specification, KPIs and guidelines for validation ", due at M24)</p>
