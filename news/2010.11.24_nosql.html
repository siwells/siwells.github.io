This was a well attended event packed to the rafters mostly with local developers but also with some attendee's from further afield. I met some great people and had a great time. A round up of the event can be found in <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/">Paul Stack</a>'s <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/Review-of-NoSql-Day-at-Dundee-University.aspx">blog post about the day</a>. I think that the success of this event was mostly down to the organisation by <a href="http://twitter.com/andycobley">Andy Cobley</a> which was exemplary. A flavour of the event can be gained by checking the twitter feed from the day at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nuac">#nuac</a>.  <strong></strong></p>
