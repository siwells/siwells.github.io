The talk was quite short and mainly covered my research interests and plans. It started with a brief overview of the core areas that I am interested in from both a theoretic and an applied perspective before I discussed a range of projects and activities that I have involved in over the last few years.  <strong>Presentation Link: </strong><a href="http://www.simonwells.org/data/downloads/presentations/aberdeen2010.pdf">aberdeen2010.pdf</a></p>
