<p>On Monday 14th January, I gave a short invited talk to <a href="http://openmicroscopy.org/site/about/development-teams/jason">members</a> of the <a href="http://openmicroscopy.org">Open Microscopy Environment project</a> based in the <a href="http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/jason_swedlow/">Swedlow Lab</a> located in the <a href="http://gre.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation &amp; Expression</a> at the <a href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/">University of Dundee</a>. There were a number of focii to this talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall research interests, starting broadly with AI, then focussing rapidly to argumentative dialogue systems, </li>
<li>the broad classes of problems that I am interested in,</li>
<li>a (very) brief, software focussed overview of projects I have been involved in sketching the thread of research from my early work on multi-agent dialogue systems through formalisation of dialogue protocols in my early post-doc research, and finishing with my most recent applied work in online argumentation, pedagogical dialogue, and web-scale argumentation technologies.</li>
