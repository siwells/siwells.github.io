I wanted to present a high-level overview of my interests and talked about my research (including MAgtALO, ArguBlogging &amp; FireBack, Parley, Warblr and the Arguing Agents Competition) and my day job working with the governance and intelligent use of of BIG healthcare datasets. I also included a few slides talking about the Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL) as some of the work that <a href="http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/">ARG:dundee</a> presented earlier builds upon DGDL as a fundamental technology.<img class="posterous_plugin_object posterous_plugin_object_file" src="/images/spacer.gif?content_part=GncHmojmuAuBCcgfcmjj" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></p>
