Paper: Building Arguments with Argumentation: The Role of Illocutionary Force in Computational Models of Argument

<ul>
<li> <strong>Abstract: </strong>"This paper builds upon the proposed dialogical extensions to the AIF, termed AIF+, by making explicit the representation of the role of illocutionary force in the connection between argument structures and dialogical structures. Illocutionary force is realised in the form of Illocutionary Application (YA-) nodes that provide an explicit linkage between the locutions uttered during a dialogue and the underlying arguments expressed by the content of those locutions."</li>
