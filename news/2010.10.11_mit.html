Interview with the MIT Technology Review

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-109" href="http://www.simonwells.org/?attachment_id=109"><img class="posterous_download_image" title="persuasive.technology" src="http://www.simonwells.org/wp-content/uploads/persuasive.technology-300x214.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>On the 17th of September, recently back from COMMA 2010 (and barely recovered) I had the good fortune of being interviewed by an editor from the MIT Technology Review about Persuasive Technology. We talked about B. J. Foggs work on captology, the strand of Persuasive Technology that encompass non-verbal approaches, and the ethical questions that are raised as a result. What was nice was that my interview was interested in the kinds of verbal persuasion that I am interested in, that is, using dialogical systems to persuade people to come to a reasonable and justifiable decision via the application of sound supporting and rebutting arguments. Anyhow, the best part is that the Technology Review asked to use my wordle from this post about <a href="http://argumentation.computing.dundee.ac.uk/?p=124">Persuasive Technology</a>. So a slightly edited version of my wordle can now be seen in the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/">MIT Technology Review</a> <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/business/26280/">special report on Digital Marketing</a>.</p>
